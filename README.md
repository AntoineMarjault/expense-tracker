## Travel Expenses Tracker

Travel Expenses Tracker is a web application I built during my recent gap year, spent traveling across 13 countries. I created this platform to track my spending, convert currencies automatically, and visualize my financial habits as I moved from place to place.

**What It Does**

- Tracks daily expenses across categories and currencies
- Automatically converts foreign transactions using real-time exchange rates
- Visualizes spending patterns and trends with interactive D3.js charts
- Detects travel periods within each country

**Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails
- **Data Visualization:** D3.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

**Key Highlights**

- Migrated the full stack from cloud platforms (Render.com, Vercel, NeonTech) to a custom VPS, reducing hosting costs and deepening my deployment skills
- Integrated real-time currency APIs with intelligent caching for fast, accurate conversions
- Built a robust, production-ready app with a clean codebase and comprehensive tests
- Continuously iterate on features and user flows as new travel challenges arise

This project is a personal tool that grew with my journeyâ€”each new country inspired improvements in usability, performance, and insight. I continue to refine it as I travel.
